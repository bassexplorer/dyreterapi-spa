        <p>
            Most often, the problem behavior of horses is completely na√Øve behavior, which is unfortunately unhelpful in our domestic horses. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We know that the horses are a prey, with which anxiety and escape reactions are equal in many situations, thus these are among the most common behavioral problems in horses. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I clarify, guide and teach the owner, and take the first practical steps with the horse, but the training itself, ultimately aimed at diminishing or completely wiping out 
            the problem behavior (depending on the owner's ambitions and options), is primarily the owner to take take care of. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The length of a training session is individual from problem to problem. In some cases, it is enough to change small routines in daily life, while in other cases intensive 
            training is needed several times a week over extended periods. During the course of the training, I can be contacted freely on Mail or Telephone.

            In some cases, we supplement the Training Program with treatment with a trip to the vet, Bach's Flower Remedies, supplements 
            or physical balancing if this proves to be the basis for this.
