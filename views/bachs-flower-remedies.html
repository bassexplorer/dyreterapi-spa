        <p>
            Bettina has been working with Bach's Flower Media for Animals since 2006, and in addition to using them as a supplement to behavioral therapy with 
            certain own clients, I receive referrals regarding. this from behavioral therapists throughout Denmark.

        <p>
            Flower remedies sound a bit mysterious and alternative, but in fact it is quite concrete and the remedy's effect is 
            scientifically proven. The remedies have passed a double blind test, which shows that we can expect to reduce the symptoms in up to 7 out 
            of 10 cases and that the remedies are not placebo.

        <p>
            Today, the Bach Center in England and Nelson Bach are responsible for the production and distribution of the remedies. After the specific flowers have been 
            collected, they are prepared based on the solar method and the cooking method. By the solar method, the flowers are placed in a bowl of spring water, and then 
            placed in the sun, which should then cause the spring water to bind the energy of the flowers. Of course, this method is only applicable at the time of year 
            when the sun's rays are strong enough.
