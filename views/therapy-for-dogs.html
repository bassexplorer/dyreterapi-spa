        <p>
            Occasionally, it can be difficult for dogs to function in our man-made world. We have adapted everyday life to the wishes 
            and needs of people, but it does not necessarily suit the dogs. They have the drives and instincts, they are herd animals, 
            they can get stressed and they communicate completely differently than we do. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, much of the unwanted behavior that we call <span class="bold">problem behavior </span>is really natural behavior for dogs, it just does not fit 
            when the dogs have to work with us in a daily life. Other causes include bad experiences - including shock, lack of or 
            inappropriate embossing or socialization.

            In some cases, we supplement the Training Program with treatment with a trip to the vet, Bach's Flower Remedies, supplements 
            or physical balancing if this proves to be the basis for this.
