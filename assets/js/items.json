    "description": "It's hard to be a dog in our world: Anything natural is considered either wrong or disgusting! The dog's natural behavior is often misunderstood, which can lead to what we call problem behavior. The author of Through the Dog's Eyes, Jean Donaldson, is called by many 'the most sensible voice in dog training', and all her training is based on understanding the dog's nature as well as positive reinforcement. In this book, which has won numerous awards in the home country of the United States as the best book on dog training, she explains why our dogs do, as they do,from an evolutionary point of view.",
